        <h2>What is Smog?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Smog is a dangerous blend of smoke and fog that can have a devastating
          effect on our health. It not only impairs air quality but also leads
          to serious respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The situation has
          reached alarming levels in cities like Lahore, where industrial
          emissions, vehicle exhausts, and burning fossil fuels exacerbate the
          pollution crisis. "The air we breathe is the most important factor in
          determining our health," yet smog continues to compromise that very
          necessity.
